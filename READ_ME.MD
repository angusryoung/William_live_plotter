## Setting it up
Because I dont want to polute my main enviroment I created a virtaul enviroment that allows me to install the needed dependencies, you might not need to do this

`setting up virtual enviroment`
`pip install virtualenv`
`python -m virtualenv .venv`
`.venv\Scripts\activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Move the file excel file into this folder and enter the filename and column name that you want to present in the config folder.

Then to run
`python excel_data_reader.py`
